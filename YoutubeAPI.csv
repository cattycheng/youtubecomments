Director Todd Phillips “Joker” centers around the iconic arch nemesis and is an original, standalone fictional story not seen before on the big screen.  Phillips’ exploration of Arthur Fleck, who is indelibly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, is of a man struggling to find his way in Gotham’s fractured society.  A clown-for-hire by day, he aspires to be a stand-up comic at night…but finds the joke always seems to be on him.  Caught in a cyclical existence between apathy and cruelty, Arthur makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study.
Three-time Oscar nominee Phoenix (“The Master,” “Walk the Line,” “Gladiator”) stars in the titular role alongside Oscar winner Robert De Niro (“Raging Bull,” “The Godfather: Part II”) as Franklin.  The film also stars Zazie Beetz (“Deadpool 2”), Frances Conroy (TV’s “American Horror Story,” Hulu’s “Castle Rock”), Marc Maron (TV’s “Maron,” “GLOW”), Bill Camp (“Red Sparrow,” “Molly’s Game”), Glenn Fleshler (TV’s “Billions,” “Barry”), Shea Whigham (“First Man,” “Kong: Skull Island”), Brett Cullen (“42,” Netflix’s “Narcos”), Douglas Hodge (“Red Sparrow,” TV’s “Penny Dreadful”) and Josh Pais (upcoming “Motherless Brooklyn,” “Going in Style”).
Oscar nominee Phillips (“Borat,” “The Hangover” trilogy) directs from a screenplay he co-wrote with Oscar-nominated writer Scott Silver (“The Fighter”), based on characters from DC.  The film is produced by Phillips and Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper (“A Star Is Born,” “American Sniper”) under their Joint Effort banner, and Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff (“The Wolf of Wall Street”).   It is executive produced by Michael E. Uslan, Walter Hamada, Aaron L. Gilbert, Joseph Garner, Richard Baratta, and Bruce Berman.
Behind the scenes, Phillips is joined by director of photography Lawrence Sher (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” “The Hangover” trilogy), production designer Mark Friedberg (“Selma,” “The Amazing Spider-Man 2”), editor Jeff Groth (“War Dogs,” “The Hangover Part III”), and Oscar-winning costume designer Mark Bridges (“Phantom Thread,” “The Artist”).  The music is by Hildur Guðnadóttir (“Sicario: Day of the Soldado”).

Pictures Presents, in Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, in Association with BRON Creative, a Joint Effort Production, a Film by Todd Phillips, “Joker.”  It will be in theaters nationwide October 4, 2019 and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros.

I find it insulting that you have to watch the entire movie only to realise it was all fake. Except two scenes, everything was true. One where he imagined himself at the Murray show being loved by everyone and second, his relationship with the neighbour. Rest everything was true, killings and everything were the events that actually occured in the context of movie. I've seen the movie 9 times on screen and it's laughable when there are certain misinterpretations by some one time viewers. Lastly, he did not kill his neighbour just like he did not kill Gary, the midget because thankfully, this joker understands empathy and well differentiates between people who have hurt him and those that were nice to him. The best method to avoid misinterpretation is to watch or read something again and again until you understand it entirely.

What an great fucking masterpiece, the cinematography, acting, music choice, dialogue, story and overall everything was amazing. Throughout the entire screening, i just wanted to cheer Arthur (Joker) on. I could honestly extremely relate to Arthur (Joker), him getting shit from everyone, everyone talking shit about him, him trying to make others laugh and just being received with nothing, etc, all of which happen to me almost daily. 11/10.

Director Todd Phillips “Joker” centers around the iconic arch nemesis and is an original, standalone fictional story not seen before on the big screen.  Phillips’ exploration of Arthur Fleck, who is indelibly portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix, is of a man struggling to find his way in Gotham’s fractured society.  A clown-for-hire by day, he aspires to be a stand-up comic at night…but finds the joke always seems to be on him.  Caught in a cyclical existence between apathy and cruelty, Arthur makes one bad decision that brings about a chain reaction of escalating events in this gritty character study.
Three-time Oscar nominee Phoenix (“The Master,” “Walk the Line,” “Gladiator”) stars in the titular role alongside Oscar winner Robert De Niro (“Raging Bull,” “The Godfather: Part II”) as Franklin.  The film also stars Zazie Beetz (“Deadpool 2”), Frances Conroy (TV’s “American Horror Story,” Hulu’s “Castle Rock”), Marc Maron (TV’s “Maron,” “GLOW”), Bill Camp (“Red Sparrow,” “Molly’s Game”), Glenn Fleshler (TV’s “Billions,” “Barry”), Shea Whigham (“First Man,” “Kong: Skull Island”), Brett Cullen (“42,” Netflix’s “Narcos”), Douglas Hodge (“Red Sparrow,” TV’s “Penny Dreadful”) and Josh Pais (upcoming “Motherless Brooklyn,” “Going in Style”).
Oscar nominee Phillips (“Borat,” “The Hangover” trilogy) directs from a screenplay he co-wrote with Oscar-nominated writer Scott Silver (“The Fighter”), based on characters from DC.  The film is produced by Phillips and Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper (“A Star Is Born,” “American Sniper”) under their Joint Effort banner, and Oscar nominee Emma Tillinger Koskoff (“The Wolf of Wall Street”).   It is executive produced by Michael E. Uslan, Walter Hamada, Aaron L. Gilbert, Joseph Garner, Richard Baratta, and Bruce Berman.
Behind the scenes, Phillips is joined by director of photography Lawrence Sher (“Godzilla: King of the Monsters,” “The Hangover” trilogy), production designer Mark Friedberg (“Selma,” “The Amazing Spider-Man 2”), editor Jeff Groth (“War Dogs,” “The Hangover Part III”), and Oscar-winning costume designer Mark Bridges (“Phantom Thread,” “The Artist”).  The music is by Hildur Guðnadóttir (“Sicario: Day of the Soldado”).
Warner Bros. Pictures Presents, in Association with Village Roadshow Pictures, in Association with BRON Creative, a Joint Effort Production, a Film by Todd Phillips, “Joker.”  It will be in theaters nationwide October 4, 2019 and will be distributed worldwide by Warner Bros. Pictures.","['joker movie', 'comics', 'joaquin phoenix', 'robert de niro', 'dc', 'dceu', 'todd phillips', 'arkham', 'gotham', 'warner bros', 'wb pictures', 'comic book', 'Joker Trailer', 'Joker Teaser Trailer', 'joker official trailer']",72706411,1428430,48863,0,136669,"['I’ve already seen the movie 2 times and I’m still watching the trailer', 'In a few years we will look back at this trailer with such nostalgic bliss', 'This movie is almost perfect yet i wish it was a tad bit underrated', ""There should never be another Joker movie made after this one.

I have Epilepsy anf Autism Asperges. \n\nThe beginning years from my birth to my elementary school years, I was nothing but a stranger. The weakest child in class always tired, exausted and distracted by my Epilepsy. Teachers treated me like I was a problem. Kept the smart and social kids away from me. Outcasted me to the corner, I frequently played by myself with my toys I had to bring from home. I was often alone. I had no friends. And when I finally got friends almost all of them abbandoned me as soon as they founded out that I had Epilepsy diagnoses. At times nobody knew that I had Autism Asperges...\n\nI was 5 years old when doctors, teachers, parents and even friends told my parents that I am weak, that I\'m never gonna be able to live on my own, to work for my own, to love, to have a family, that I woudn\'t even be able to establish friendships....I was gonna be a problem....they never said it this way but they damn well sended it over to not only me but my parents....\n\nWorst part of it all was that while i was being born a young doctor in college opperated on me and screwed me up by not cleaning my lounges. I sufficated and brain damage was done. So not only they took my chances of becoming intelligent they are very likely the reason I am who I am to this day. \nThe night before doctors often told my parents that i could be the smartest son they yet created. I have 2 smart brothers both high IQ. Both got high degree from college. But me? I was gonna be the smartest! Doctors kept talking of how smart i could become even my IQ could be between 120/136.\nThey took that from me. \n\nThen from the age of 10 I was forced to leave my one and only bestfriend who loved and accepted me for who I am to go to this ""Special High School"" where I got bullied so badly that my parents and the school principal were onces again forced to drop me out from there and putted me on a different special school where i got bullied even worse and experienced multiple beat up attempts. I got in a depression and I started to see myself as a problem, an object, a mistake in a succesful family. This went from my 10th to my 16th when I finally got out of my depression and had a greatfriend to talk with. \n\nI\'m now studying on a more mature special job school where there are adults. I met there a sweetgirl who now became my bestfriend. She means the world to me. I see her as my soulmate as my sister I see her as the most precious thing life ever throwed at me. She aslo cares so much about me and she even makes time and always puts her problems aside to just hear me out and to help me. I would take a bullet for her any day any time.  \n\nI\'m not asking for pityness. All I\'ve been asking is that I wanted to be treated the same and to this day. I frequently have the feeling that my parents don\'t listen to me. You know where you\'re being putted in society when people say things like; You don\'t understand cause of your Autism. You can\'t come with ous cause of your Epilepsy. You can\'t negotiate with us. You\'re Autistic! From the beginning I told myself that I could be normal. That I could be part of society and everyone laughed me same as the Joker but now? I don\'t want to have anything with society anymore. They made me not carring. Now I focus on my closest 2 friends who treat me as a equal and respect me. and on family of what\'s left of it.. thank you for your attention.', 'S O C I E T Y', 'Me encanta 😃😃😃', '2:00 pls tell me I will die this way', '이거 엄마랑 봣는데 재밌음', 'What a good movie to protray our badass villain, Joker!', 'Any kid who understands all this shit but he is under 15 so he couldnt watch.\nI couldnt im dying inside😓', 'Miss you dark knight joker 😥😥😥😥😥', ""I'm from Russia !!!\nIN RUSSIA ANSHLAG !!!\nPeople applaud !!! 👍👍👍💯🔥"", 'Joker: “put a smile on your face”\n\n\nThanos “now this does put a smile on my face”', ""DC' s best movie"", '0:12 *bruh my heart just broke!*', 'That shot & that walk at 02:03 is so insane.', 'Joker lagi viral di Indonesia', 'A couple of little clips that arent in the movie.

I remember the comments were more scarce back in those days and also there were more negative comments. Makes me feel like a real Harley Quinn in the Warner Bros world now thinking back. Couldn’t be happier to have cheered on Joaquin while they were still finishing up the film. He’s a great standalone actor but everyone could use someone to cheer them on in the face of being ridiculed entirely by most people. Went and saw Joker at a 6$ showing at a vintage movie theatre last Wednesday and sat through the entire thing. My favorite people playing Batman villains of all time are Danny Devito, Heath Ledger, and Joaquin Phoenix: an even tie. However seeing as Joaquin was born in the same place that I was I think that this movie was really special and I would thank him for making it and me feel that way. Long live this Joker. I hope he does transcend the fictional streets of Gotham on screen into any town or city where this film is being shown.

I have Epilepsy anf Autism Asperges. \n\nThe beginning years from my birth to my elementary school years, I was nothing but a stranger. The weakest child in class always tired, exausted and distracted by my Epilepsy. Teachers treated me like I was a problem. Kept the smart and social kids away from me. Outcasted me to the corner, I frequently played by myself with my toys I had to bring from home. I was often alone. I had no friends. And when I finally got friends almost all of them abbandoned me as soon as they founded out that I had Epilepsy diagnoses. At times nobody knew that I had Autism Asperges...\n\nI was 5 years old when doctors, teachers, parents and even friends told my parents that I am weak, that I\'m never gonna be able to live on my own, to work for my own, to love, to have a family, that I woudn\'t even be able to establish friendships....I was gonna be a problem....they never said it this way but they damn well sended it over to not only me but my parents....\n\nWorst part of it all was that while i was being born a young doctor in college opperated on me and screwed me up by not cleaning my lounges. I sufficated and brain damage was done. So not only they took my chances of becoming intelligent they are very likely the reason I am who I am to this day. \nThe night before doctors often told my parents that i could be the smartest son they yet created. I have 2 smart brothers both high IQ. Both got high degree from college. But me? I was gonna be the smartest! Doctors kept talking of how smart i could become even my IQ could be between 120/136.\nThey took that from me. \n\nThen from the age of 10 I was forced to leave my one and only bestfriend who loved and accepted me for who I am to go to this ""Special High School"" where I got bullied so badly that my parents and the school principal were onces again forced to drop me out from there and putted me on a different special school where i got bullied even worse and experienced multiple beat up attempts. I got in a depression and I started to see myself as a problem, an object, a mistake in a succesful family. This went from my 10th to my 16th when I finally got out of my depression and had a greatfriend to talk with. \n\nI\'m now studying on a more mature special job school where there are adults. I met there a sweetgirl who now became my bestfriend. She means the world to me. I see her as my soulmate as my sister I see her as the most precious thing life ever throwed at me. She aslo cares so much about me and she even makes time and always puts her problems aside to just hear me out and to help me. I would take a bullet for her any day any time.  \n\nI\'m not asking for pityness. All I\'ve been asking is that I wanted to be treated the same and to this day. I frequently have the feeling that my parents don\'t listen to me. You know where you\'re being putted in society when people say things like; You don\'t understand cause of your Autism. You can\'t come with us cause of your Epilepsy. You can\'t negotiate with us. You\'re Autistic! From the beginning I told myself that I could be normal. That I could be part of society and everyone laughed me same as the Joker but now? I don\'t want to have anything with society anymore. They made me not carring. Now I focus on my closest 2 friends who treat me as a equal and respect me. and on family of what\'s left of it.. thank you for your attention.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgGmQZn77Uw', '📲*00212.645.75.23.01* *whatapps*📲\nولاحـظــت💁\u200d♂️ كــثــيــر مـن الــكــومــنــتــات عــن تـكـبـيـر الــقــضــيــب وضـعـف الانــتــصــاب وسـرعـة الــقــذف\nوأبــغــى أبـشـركـم😉 أنـي حــصــلــت عـلـى مــعــلــومــات مـفـيـدة✅ هــتــنــفــعــكــم كـثـيـر ومــجــربــهــا شــخــصــيــا ونـفـعـتـنـي🤩🥳\nتـواصـل مــعــي🙋\u200d♂️ وأنـا بـشـرح لــك ســر الــوصــفــة الـواتـسـاب *00212.645.75.23.01*📲', 'Im french but the French Version of the voice is so bad omg', 'I guess I can understand why people think Clowns are creepy and insane!', ""Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in this and I was surprised very surprised how they did this movie.

A sad scene will make everyone sad, nothing new in that. But comic scenes have to be really great in order to involve a larger audience.

Oscar ready for sure💯💯💯', 'Ok here is a story if you\'re interested about why this movie hitted me so hard.\n\nI\'m a young, shy and unsure adult that is 19 years old. I have Epilepsy anf Autism Asperges. \n\nThe beginning years from my birth to my elementary school years, I was nothing but a stranger. The weakest child in class always tired, exausted and distracted by my Epilepsy. Teachers treated me like I was a problem. Kept the smart and social kids away from me. Outcasted me to the corner, I frequently played by myself with my toys I had to bring from home. I was often alone. I had no friends. And when I finally got friends almost all of them abbandoned me as soon as they founded out that I had Epilepsy diagnoses. At times nobody knew that I had Autism Asperges...\n\nI was 5 years old when doctors, teachers, parents and even friends told my parents that I am weak, that I\'m never gonna be able to live on my own, to work for my own, to love, to have a family, that I woudn\'t even be able to establish friendships....I was gonna be a problem....they never said it this way but they damn well sended it over to not only me but my parents....\n\nWorst part of it all was that while i was being born a young doctor in college opperated on me and screwed me up by not cleaning my lounges. I sufficated and brain damage was done. So not only they took my chances of becoming intelligent they are very likely the reason I am who I am to this day. \nThe night before doctors often told my parents that i could be the smartest son they yet created. I have 2 smart brothers both high IQ. Both got high degree from college. But me? I was gonna be the smartest! Doctors kept talking of how smart i could become even my IQ could be between 120/136.\nThey took that from me. \n\nThen from the age of 10 I was forced to leave my one and only bestfriend who loved and accepted me for who I am to go to this ""Special High School"" where I got bullied so badly that my parents and the school principal were onces again forced to drop me out from there and putted me on a different special school where i got bullied even worse and experienced multiple beat up attempts. I got in a depression and I started to see myself as a problem, an object, a mistake in a succesful family. This went from my 10th to my 16th when I finally got out of my depression and had a greatfriend to talk with. \n\nI\'m now studying on a more mature special job school where there are adults. I met there a sweetgirl who now became my bestfriend. She means the world to me. I see her as my soulmate as my sister I see her as the most precious thing life ever throwed at me. She aslo cares so much about me and she even makes time and always puts her problems aside to just hear me out and to help me. I would take a bullet for her any day any time.  \n\nI\'m not asking for pityness. All I\'ve been asking is that I wanted to be treated the same and to this day. I frequently have the feeling that my parents don\'t listen to me. You know where you\'re being putted in society when people say things like; You don\'t understand cause of your Autism. You can\'t come with us cause of your Epilepsy. You can\'t negotiate with us. You\'re Autistic! From the beginning I told myself that I could be normal. That I could be part of society and everyone laughed me same as the Joker but now? I don\'t want to have anything with society anymore. They made me not carring. Now I focus on my closest 2 friends who treat me as a equal and respect me. and on family of what\'s left of it.. thank you for your attention.', 'Dam i fanaly watch the full movie damn its so good', 'I got emotional watching this movie', 'If this film was offered to SALMAN KHAN............??', '📲*00212645752301* *whatapps*📲\nوجـدت💁\u200d♂️ كــثــيــر مـن الـتـعـالـيـق عــن تـكـبـيـر الـقـضـيـب وضـعـف الانــتــصــاب وســرعــة الـقـذف\nوأبــغــى أبــشــركــم😉 أنـي حـصـلـت عــلــى مــعــلــومــات كــثــيــر مـفـيـدة✅ هــتــنــفــعــكــم كــثــيــر ومـجـربـهـا شــخــصــيــا ونــفــعــتــنــي🤩🥳\nتــواصــل مـعـي🙋\u200d♂️ وأنــا بـشـرح لـك ســر الـوصـفـة الـواتـسـاب *00212645752301*📲', 'i play this video put my head phone while on my way to work repeatedly. 😀', 'Good job walkin...

A misunderstood person in society who wants him to act normal when he has a mental condition that makes him laugh out of the blue.

I as the mother of an austitic child watching this movie startled me immensely to see how people treat the difficulties of others and the mental illnesses they carry without blaming it. The world is sicker and more mentally polluted than any being born with a mental illness that because it is not a physical illness and does not see itself already attacked him as if he were some pervert at last ... This rotten world. I sincerely hope my death is happier than my life. And that every human born with a mental problem without any fault that was not treated as garbage. It's just what I want one day. Because unfortunately mental illness nobody is free and when it touches us the pain starts to feel in the first person and then it really hurts. And to have a pseudo mother who took advantage of her son's mental condition to let the father abuse him at last ... Sad reality today the weak and oppressed suffer at the hands of demons. Anyway ...

Mulan,Disney&#39;s Mulan - Official Teaser,2019-07-07T16:02:17.000Z,"When the Emperor of China issues a decree that one man per family must serve in the Imperial Army to defend the country from Northern invaders, Hua Mulan, the eldest daughter of an honored warrior, steps in to take the place of her ailing father. Masquerading as a man, Hua Jun, she is tested every step of the way and must harness her inner-strength and embrace her true potential. It is an epic journey that will transform her into an honored warrior and earn her the respect of a grateful nation…and a proud father. “Mulan” features a celebrated international cast that includes: Yifei Liu as Mulan; Donnie Yen as Commander Tung; Jason Scott Lee as Böri Khan; Yoson An as Cheng Honghui; with Gong Li as Xianniang and Jet Li as the Emperor. The film is directed by Niki Caro from a screenplay by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver and Elizabeth Martin & Lauren Hynek based on the narrative poem “The Ballad of Mulan.”

While the animated version is definitely a fun movie, this remake is based on the Ballad of Mulan and it's meant to be more realistic and true to Chinese culture. I believe the animated version is a spin on the ballad intended for young audiences, and this is a more accurate depiction for older audiences. Mulan came out when I was a kid and I grew up watching that movie and loving it, I still do, but that doesn't make me any less excited to see this film and I'm actually more excited to see this than I was the animated version bc of it's historical accuracy.

Without the funny little Mushu dragon (voiced by Will Smith again, of course), and the old songs, this is going to come off as just another quasi-historical Chinese costume drama that everybody falls asleep while watching on Netflix.   The truth of the matter is that you couldn't make this without Chinese Government support, and they DID NOT want you to present the Imperial Dragon, one of the most powerful and sacred symbols of China, as a goofy, little red lizard.  If you could have supplied your Chinese masters with a bit more fierce and dignified version of Mushu in the screenplay, they might have allowed it, but you didn't have the guts to stand up to them.

It’s staying true to the real story as it possibly can (without the death etc) .If a non animated movie was being made about a historical story I think it’s only right they do the real story justice and remove the things that , although were amazing in the animated version ,  in the real life remake needed to be removed for the sake of retelling a legend. Of course everyone can have their own opinions. This is just my take on it :)', 'I love how people are still  saying ""Disney ran out of ideas"" and yet you\'re still paying money to go see these movies and they end up being pretty damn good or at least better than expected. I loved maleficent because it was a spicy twist, a story about a villain. I was incredibly impressed with  lion king because making animated singing lions into live action is FREAKING HARD. To any of you that has belittled that movie is flat out disrespectful to animators and just the film industry in general. You guys have no idea how hard it is to make that kind of thing work. Understand that when Disney does live action movies they do it because they want to bring back the stories that we grew up with and serve it to the younger generations as well. Honoring the real stories, showing how much technology has changed, making the movies more diverse, so that little black girls don\'t have to be princess tiana for Halloween, they can be Ariel if they wanted to, and putting a little spin in the story as well. There is nothing wrong with that because we love it. Why? Because it makes the magic feel real. So it\'s not lazy, its brilliant yet incredibly challenging. So relax. Don\'t be one of those sour puses that ruin the movie for other people just because YOU didn\'t like it. Sorry if it bothers you to see people excited and happy  to relive their childhood again.', 'I thought she is meant to dress like a boy to join the army?

But she wanted in choir or in the shower and not as constantly...anyway I'm straying away from the point. I could care less that there will be no singing( is sad, yes since Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast had it, but I can get over it) however I want it to be as close as they can get it to the movie as they can get it. I know the original story, and trust me, I wish Disney would have done that story for Mulan too(I would have love it just as much, she was just as much a hero, and it was true story in Chinese history), but I fell in love as a Child with the movie...so I want it be like the film, maybe throw in more historical facts, like her brother, etc. However I want the film, and a remake of that... but that's just my opinion. Again this has been my favorite film for so long, and when I heard they were going to remake my heart nearly exploded with excitement, like it did with Lion king, however after the first trailer of said film of LK, my enthusiasm immediately fell.

Mulan,The Chinese React To Disney’s Mulan Trailer | ASIAN BOSS,2019-07-19T01:54:43.000Z,"Mulan is one of the most famous animated films made by Disney, who recently released a trailer for the live-action remake. So far, people’s reactions appear to be mixed, partially on the basis there won’t be any songs or talking dragons. A lot of you have asked, how is this trailer received in mainland China? We hit the streets of Beijing to find out. 

The opinions expressed in this video are those of individual interviewees alone and do not reflect the views of ASIAN BOSS or the general Chinese population.

There has been a live action Mulan movie made years ago and Im pretty sure it follows more of the real history of Mulan. I've never truly studied the real history, but if Chinese people do in schools then they will be looking for more realism in the story. With the way Blockbuster movies are being made in the last few years in the USA, they don't care about that much anymore. They just want that picture to look cool or pretty. I really hope the Chinese isn't offended by the new remake Disney will create because I know it will suck."", 'This new movie is so stupid I like the old one better', 'Thank you for the video. I was curious as to what China thought too', '2:03 oh yes so true', '这次迪士尼的《花木兰》当成一部根据历史故事改编的歌舞片还是很不错的!  但是有人要是硬说这是一部严谨的历史电影的话，我只能表示“你开心就好”。 顺带一提  刘亦菲姐姐不愧是仙女儿   离仙剑已经过去那么长时间了 还依旧保持着自己特有的仙女气质。', 'Heart Evangelista an actress from the Philippines would have been a perfect Mulan.', 'I agree with the girl in the white Champion shirt.

Chinese movies are better left in the hands of actual Chinese developers. after watching The Untamed. they are far more suited to make heavy cultural related movies/series.', ""Mulan's story so false"", ""I appreciate the guys comment about how live-actions destroys the animation story and vice versa. in general I really don't like remakes and reboots"", 'While at one aspect I can agree and understand, saying that ""the movie might deviate from the real story with all the special effects."" It\'s almost childish. American audiences are po about the gay icon, music and talking dragon disappearing from the film. The story has already been thrown to the wayside, it might become more to the story without the extra nonsense people focus on.', ""Lol I'm used to the martial arts.

Anyways I feel like the movie will remove the comedic-ness that came with the animation.....like is there no Mushu and cricket?', 'Mulan sucks and the actress was a bad cast.

So they are literally changing the knowledge of Hua Mu Lan herself so people misunderstand that the story in the Movies are what actually happened, since the actual story doesn\'t have such a love story or happy ending. I don\'t hate Disney for this, since the animation itself is amazing and I sure the live action movie would be just as good. I just hope that maybe in the beginning of the movies, give a little precaution like :""What happens in this movie is not what actually happened in history, but has been changed and is only based on a part of Chinese History."" so people know that the movie is not perfectly non-fiction and to also for people to acknowledge that the background story was actually based on real Chinese history.

IN the U.S., you see the commodification on black culture and other cultures, yet there is still disrespect towards those people who created those cultures. I think people need to understanding the difference between embracing all aspect of a culture including its people and commodifying a culture for economic gains. In the U.S., people love capitalism and money but disrespect non-white/Western and Northern European cultures, which can be seen all over media coming out of the U.S. Representation and inclusion is what is making money these days, so the exploitation of black, Asian, etc cultures will definitely be popular.

Parasite,"Parasite [Official Trailer] – In Theaters October 11, 2019",2019-08-14T15:04:13.000Z,"Act like you own the place. #Parasite is in US Theaters October 11. 

Bong Joon Ho brings his singular mastery home to Korea in this pitch-black modern fairytale.

Meet the Park Family: the picture of aspirational wealth. And the Kim Family, rich in street smarts but not much else. Be it chance or fate, these two houses are brought together and the Kims sense a golden opportunity. Masterminded by college-aged Ki-woo, the Kim children expediently install themselves as tutor and art therapist, to the Parks. Soon, a symbiotic relationship forms between the two families. The Kims provide “indispensable” luxury services while the Parks obliviously bankroll their entire household. When a parasitic interloper threatens the Kims’ newfound comfort, a savage, underhanded battle for dominance breaks out, threatening to destroy the fragile ecosystem between the Kims and the Parks.

By turns darkly hilarious and heart-wrenching, PARASITE showcases a modern master at the top of his game.","['Parasite', 'Bong Joon Ho', 'Okja', 'Snowpiercer', 'The Host', ""Palm d'Or"", 'Song Kang Ho', 'Lee Sun Kyun', 'Jo Yeo Jeong', 'Park So Dam', 'Kang-Ho Song', 'Sun-Kyun Lee', 'Yeo-Jeong Jo', 'Woo-sik Choi', 'Hye-jin Jang', 'So-dam Park', 'Joon-Ho Bong', 'Gisaengchung', '기생충', '봉준호', '송강호', '이선균', '조여정', '최우식', '박소담', 'Choi Woo Sik', 'Jang Hye Jin']",3727504,23934,521,0,1992,"['Hollywood?

Burning undoubtedly deserved an oscar nom this year but i hope this becomes Koreas first oscar nomination it deserves it', 'Spoilers ahead:\r\n\r\nThe word ""masterpiece"" gets used a lot these days to the point that its lost its meaning. People would even call blockbuster popcorn flicks a ""masterpiece"" these days. That being said, I gave this movie a watch out of curiosity after I saw a few people deem it a ""masterpiece"". This movie is literally like the Japanese movie Shoplifters, only instead of shoplifting to survive, this family leeches off of other people to survive. The story starts with the premise that this family leeches off of other people to survive down to even stealing wifi from other people. Koreans do a great job of making unlikeable characters as protagonists since I felt the same dislike I had towards the protagonists of this movie towards the protagonists of The Handmaiden. Unlike Shoplifters, this movie made each member of the parasitic family dislikeable to the point that you wish death upon them. The daughter of the parasitic family (Ki-jeong) in particular was so unlikeable to the point that I wished death upon her as I watched the movie. Hell,she was acting and speaking like a drunk would for most of the movie and even spoke like a drunkard as she was getting stabbed by the deranged husband of the housekeeper and bleeding to death. I liked the social commentary this movie had by showing the divide of class between the rich and the poor. It also had its moments of black comedy humor here and there. I would have been angry if these characters got a happy ening but I\'m glad its a grim and bleak ending we got at the end. Altho, how Ki-Woo survived getting hit with a stone twice on the head is beyond me. I\'m no neurosurgeon but how he is functioning as a normal human being despite that and avoided braindamage makes me question if this is possible. Overall, I enjoyed the movie despite its initial predictability of the family members replacing the servants of the rich family and enjoying a life of leisure the house of this rich family had to offer as they worked for them. For me, things started taking a turn when it was revealed that the former housekeeper was leeching off of this rich family as well and had a husband held up in the bunker whom she fed regularly. Thats when my interest peeked since I was about to give up on this movie when I saw these unlikeable characters enjoy a luxurious lifestyle as they leeched off the rich family. It would have been nice if the protagonists were more likeable and if this rich family they leech off were mean or abusive instead of the nice family they were potrayed to be in the movie since that would have given us a chance to root for the former despite the parasitic family\'s sins. Either way, the film takes a bit to get interesting and to get out of the bowels of predictablility but despite that, I wouldn\'t call it a ""masterpiece"" like most reviewers claim it to be. I have never seen a movie made by Bong Joon-ho so I\'m completely unbiased since most people will call anything made by their favorite directos a ""masterpiece"" these days.
